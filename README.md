# FakeXCOM Project
This project aim at creating an open source framework to create prototype level of the game XCOM (Enemy Unknown and XCOM2 alike) within the Unreal Engine. With it, you will be able to create with relative ease new Level, new Unit with different abilities and an AI system that can be adapted to those changes.

# Important note:
- This is not a framework that can easely be change to any kind of Turn Base shooter, it has been made specifically with the rules of XCOM in mind. It could be use as a starting point for a new kind of Turn Base Shooter, but it would require significant work
- I am not an employe of 2K game, nor did I ever work for them in the past, the algorithm use and source code are from my own speculation on how they might have done the game. That being said, this mean I do own the source code of this project
- I do not mind you using the code for your own interest (school project, personal interest, etc.), but any commercial use should at least credit me and should be mentioned to me.
- ![#f03c15]The current version of this project is not finished and development is still ongoing, the current presentation is mainly to showcase what already had been done and the way it is implemented`#f03c15`
